                    <p>Developed a sarcasm detection model using Transformer-based architecture to tackle the growing challenge of identifying sarcasm in online text. The project involved extensive data preprocessing, text cleaning, and the construction of a custom Transformer encoder incorporating Multi-Head Attention, positional encoding, and feedforward layers. By capturing nuanced contextual dependencies in language, the model achieved high accuracy and precision in distinguishing sarcastic from non-sarcastic content. Performance was evaluated using average precision score, accuracy, and confusion matrix, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in handling the complexities of sarcastic expressions.</p>
